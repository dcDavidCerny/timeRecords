                <h1>Thank You for Visiting!</h1>
                <p>Hey there! <br />

                    I just wanted to take a moment to thank you for spending some time on my site and exploring the mini-games Iâ€™ve created. This project started as a simple addition to my GitHub portfolio, but along the way, it turned into something much more fun and rewarding to build.</p>
                <p>The games you played, whether it was matching colors, solving equations, popping that tricky circle, or testing your memory, are a reflection of my journey learning and experimenting with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and a variety of libraries. Each mini-game was designed to challenge myself while keeping things fun and engaging for anyone who drops by.</p>
                <p>While this might not be a site I update in the future, itâ€™s a small milestone in my personal growth and a step toward bigger projects ahead. My ultimate goal is to continue learning, creating, and sharing ideas, and I hope this little collection of games brought a smile to your day (or at least kept you clicking for a bit longer than expected!) ðŸ˜…</p>
                <p>If you found this site interesting, Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts or even just know you stopped by! Feel free to connect or check out the rest of my portfolio on GitHub.</p>
                <p>Thank you again for your time, your clicks, and your curiosity. It means a lot! ðŸ¥° <br />

                    Warm regards, <br /> <br />
