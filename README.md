# 🎮 Minigames Collection  

Welcome to my collection of fun and interactive mini-games! This project is a showcase of my coding journey, featuring games built using **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **React**, and various libraries. It started as a portfolio project but turned into a creative playground for experimenting with game design and functionality.  

## 🚀 Try it Out!

## 🕹️ List of Games:  

#### 🟥 Same Colors Wins!  
- *Click on squares to change their colors until all squares are the same color.*  

#### 🎈 Make it Pop!  
- *Test your reflexes by clicking on a moving balloon to pop it. The challenge increases with each round!*  

#### ➕ Some Math Practice!  
- *Solve equations by clicking the square with the correct answer. A simple and fun way to brush up on your math skills!*  

#### 🧠 Pairs Memory!  
- *Sharpen your memory by finding matching emoji pairs. After a brief preview, one emoji from each pair will be hidden—can you find its match?*  

#### 🔢 Select to Add Up To!  
- *Click on squares to select numbers that add up to a randomly generated target number. Choose wisely!*  

## ✨ Features  
- **Interactive Design:** Engaging mini-games designed for quick fun.  
- **Responsive Layout:** Optimized for different screen sizes.  
- **Tech Stack:**  
  - JavaScript, TypeScript  
  - React  
  - CSS for styling  
  - Additional libraries for functionality and design enhancements  


## 💡 About the Project  
This project serves as a part of my **portfolio**, showcasing my coding, problem-solving, and design skills. Each game was an opportunity to dive deeper into JavaScript logic, React components, and creating dynamic, user-friendly interfaces.  

While there’s no user authentication or database integration (I skipped the API adventure for now! 😅), the focus here is on the fun and functionality of the games themselves.

##### It was a challange:
While this project seemed simple at first *(in my eyes drastically easier in many ways <sub><sup>😅</sup></sub>)*, I faced challenges such as designing the game logic, managing state effectively in React, and ensuring the layout was responsive and user-friendly. However, each obstacle was an opportunity to learn and improve, and I’m proud of how it all came together.

## 🛠️ Future Plans  
While I don’t plan to update this project further, it’s an important milestone in my learning journey, and I’m excited to apply and improve these skills to even bigger projects!
